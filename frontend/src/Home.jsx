At the heart of our mission lies a bold and compassionate vision — to bridge the educational divide by harnessing the power of AI to reach the underserved, the overlooked, and the unheard. We envision a world where every child, regardless of their background, location, or circumstance, has access to quality learning resources and personalized educational support. Our AI-assisted platform is designed to empower the poor and wayward sections of society, offering them a second chance to dream, grow, and build a better future. We believe education is a right, not a privilege — and through technology, we aim to make that right a reality for all.

GyanGrid is a next-generation educational intelligence platform built to bridge the gaps in India’s school ecosystem — from urban classrooms to rural blackboards. Designed with empathy, powered by AI, and aligned with the NEP 2020 vision, GyanGrid empowers students, teachers, and school administrators through personalized insights, real-time analytics, and an inclusive digital experience.

Our platform brings together academic tracking, class management, digital fee/salary payments, and an integrated e-marketplace — all in one unified dashboard that works online and offline, across languages, and on low-cost devices.

But we’re more than just an EdTech tool — we’re a mission.
A mission to ensure that no child is left behind, no teacher unsupported, and no school disconnected from the data that can drive real transformation.

With features like daily quizzes, topic-level progress tracking, grievance redressal, and our unique ReConnect device redistribution model, we’re not just digitizing classrooms — we’re building a sustainable ecosystem of equity, access, and educational upliftment.

Backed by innovation, driven by impact, and built by a team that believes in the power of inclusive technology — GyanGrid is not just EdTech.
It’s EduQuity.
